In particular, demonstrators plan to protest against the non-indictment of New York Police Department (NYPD) Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the chokehold incident that led to Garner\xe2\x80\x99s death in 2014. The day of protests is in part coordinated by Justice League NYC, a social justice youth activist organization centered on issues of juvenile justice reform and police use of force. Participants in the actions are demanding that New York officials fire Officer Pantaleo and all other officers involved in the death of Eric Garner. In addition, demonstrators are calling for the resignation of Commissioner Bill Bratton, who served as Police Commissioner in the city during the time of Garner\xe2\x80\x99s death. Protest organizers have purposefully declined to reveal the exact meeting places and times of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s protests. At this time, organizers have only revealed that actions will occur in both Manhattan and Staten Island. Specific details regarding the protests are to be released shortly before the demonstrations occur.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAssessment: Justice League NYC has organized similar demonstrations and marches throughout the city in previous months, especially relating to issues of police use of force. The group is highly organized; for Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings, the Justice League has established \xe2\x80\x9ctraining\xe2\x80\x9d sessions for interested protesters, teaching select tactics for civil disobedience without resorting to violent confrontation. Previous demonstrations, such as a march planned to commemorate the death of Freddie Gray in April, have resulted in major road closures and the arrests of several demonstrators on charges including disorderly conduct. The lack of available, specific detail regarding Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s protests is most likely a purposeful effort by the organization to maximize the disruptive potential of the demonstrations. By staging the actions in a semi-spontaneous manner, the protesters may be able to block roads and travel throughout the city while evading a heavily pre-planned law enforcement response. The exact number of people expected to participate in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s actions was not immediately specified. In any case, protest-related disruptions, such as traffic delays, resultant police presences, and arrests, may be expected.</p>'}
